# hello-world
Hello!  I'm Yoon Ha Lee and I'm doing the "hello world" exercise to familiarize myself with github 101 before doing anything regrettable to a joint project being headed up by a friend.  I'm not particularly good at coding but I won't be responsible for the heavy lifting there; I'm just trying to get up to speed on the basics.

I'm from Houston, I live in the South, and my favorite drink is Thai iced tea.
